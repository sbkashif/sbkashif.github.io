Determined the characteristic fouling mechanism of polyamide membranes using molecular dynamics simulations. The study focused on the interaction between the membrane surface and various foulants, providing insights into how fouling occurs at the molecular level. The findings can help in designing better membranes with reduced fouling tendencies.

More details will be added once the paper is shared on arXiv.
