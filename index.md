## Hello! I'm Salman, currently a Research Professional at the University of Minnesota.

My previous postdoctoral training with [Prof. Kaihang Shi](https://shiresearchgroup.github.io) focused on understanding selectivity mechanisms in zeolitic membranes for applications in energy storage and chemical seperations. Prior to that, I completed my PhD from Clemson University in [Prof. Sapna Sarupria's](https://sampel-group.github.io) group where I investigated fouling mechanisms in polyamide water purification membranes.

### Expertise:
- Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations
- Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
- Software development for computational chemistry applications
- High-throughput simulations for dataset generation
- Data-driven discovery of materials with target properties
- Machine learning-enabled enhanced sampling for molecular simulations
- Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations
