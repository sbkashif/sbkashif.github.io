## Hello! I'm Salman, currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at SUNY Buffalo.

My postdoctoral work with [Prof. Kaihang Shi](https://shiresearchgroup.github.io) focuses on understanding selectivity mechanisms in zeolitic membranes for applications in energy storage and chemical seperations. Prior to this, I completed my PhD from Clemson University in [Prof. Sapna Sarupria's](https://sarupriagroup.github.io) group where I investigated fouling mechanisms in polyamide water purification membranes.

### Expertise:
- Molecular dynamics simulations
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Machine learning-enabled enhanced sampling for molecular simulations
- Data-driven discovery of materials with target properties
- Software development for computational chemistry applications
- High-throughput simulations for dataset generation
- Machine learning interatomic potentials (so far, have only done tutorials without a formal research project)
