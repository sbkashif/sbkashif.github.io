## Hello! I'm Salman, currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at SUNY Buffalo.

My postdoctoral work with [Prof. Kaihang Shi](https://shiresearchgroup.github.io) focuses on understanding selectivity mechanisms in zeolitic membranes toward applications in energy storage and chemical seperations. Prior to this, I completed my PhD from Clemson University under [Prof. Sapna Sarupria's](https://sarupriagroup.github.io) guidance where I specialized in investigating fouling mechanisms in polyamdie membranes using molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning. 

### Expertise
- Molecular dynamics simulations
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Machine learning for materials science
- Software development for computational chemistry
