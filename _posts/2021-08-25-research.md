My PhD project involves using molecular simulations. Most likely, my future work profile would be centered around utilizing this thechnique. Hence, I take the opportunity to share my journey on how I ended up chosing this field of work. I chose this project mostly due to my strong inclination towards computational research. But, as with many other aspects in grad school, there were a few circumstantial obligations too.
