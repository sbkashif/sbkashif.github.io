In this blog post today, I am going to recollect on how I ended up working in the field of computational molecular sciences -- a mix of a few naive and few well-thought decisions. 

From what I recall, it was a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) workshop that I attended during my sophomore year that stoked my interest in computational work. Alongside being impressed with the profound insights that CFD simulations offered in a simple flow in a pipe system, there was another sight which is fresh in my memory to date. I saw a fellow student helping a faculty member in creating the geometries on Ansys Design Modeler (DM). That faculy member was our instructor of a very rigrous course -- Engineering Drawing (ED). We used to spend nights to come up with okayish techincal drawings which would fetch us average grades. The Ansys DM software appeared a leveler where the skillfull hands of that instructor had little impact on the neatness of drawings. Later, of course, I would come to know that engineering drawings are better done on specialized software like AutoCAD, and more importantly, that the skills learned from that ED course were in no way obselete. However, I was convinced that the computational tools are indispensable in any field, and building a career around those would be both exciting and rewarding.

For the remainder of my undergred program, I would study the computational courses with a greater zeal. I started to enjoy writing codes and did my undergrad project on a problem that utilized the Image Processing Tool of MATLAB. Eventually, I joined a masters program where I would do a CFD-based project on modeling of fluid flow in a microchannel. Going through the literature and through the feedback in biannual reviews on my project, I realized CFD anlaysis will not suffice in driving the project to the desired outcome, and it would need a kinetic and thermodynamic study. Conidering the short duration of my masters program, there wasn't much time left to study the problem with another robust technique. But I became interested in studying the molecular-level interactions instead of the systems under continuum approximation. Those simulations seemed to align better with the projects offered in a chemical engineering department.

A few months and numerous grad school applications later, I began my work with Prof. Sapna Sarupria on a project involving molecular simulations of seawater desalination membranes. I am working on simulating the ion transport inside the membrane pores in sub-nm domain.  This study is aimed towards getting a better understanding of salt rejection mechanism in water filters. 

While I am yet to fully explore the advances made in the molecular simulations and know the challenges before making an informed decisions, I would probably stay in this field. I have also extended my domain to scientific software development, which greatly helped in exploring my research questions in a systemic way. I am excited to pursue challenging problems at the intersection of material science, biophysics and machine learning. Unless I find myself writing another blog post explaining my switch to yet another field :)
