In today's blog post, I'll reflect on my journey into computational molecular sciences, marked by a gentle blend of haphazard impulses and carefully considered decisions.

I remember attending a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) workshop in my sophomore year, which stoked my interest in computational work. The profound insights gained from CFD simulations, from a tutorial on a simple flow in a pipe system, were impressive. A vivid memory that remains with me is witnessing a fellow student assisting a faculty member in using Ansys Design Modeler (DM). This faculty member, who also taught our rigorous Engineering Drawing (ED) course, presented a stark contrast in this new setting. We often spent a huge amount of time preparing mediocre technical drawings for that course, only achieving average grades. The Ansys DM software seemed to be a leveler of sorts, minimizing the impact of skillful hands on the neatness of the drawings. Of course, later I would learn more specialized engineering drawing tools and, more importantly, understand that the learning outcomes from that ED course were far from obsolete. Nonetheless, this experience cemented my belief in the indispensable nature of computational tools across various fields, promising an exciting and rewarding career.

For the rest of my undergraduate program, I pursued computational courses with increased enthusiasm. I enjoyed coding and completed my undergraduate project using MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox. This led me to a master's program, where I embarked on a CFD-based project focusing on fluid flow modeling in microchannels. Delving into literature and receiving feedback during biannual project reviews, I realized that CFD analysis alone wouldn't suffice to answer the questions I was interested in. Those questions required kinetic and thermodynamic modeling. With limited time in my master's program, I couldn't explore these aspects thoroughly. However, I became fascinated with studying molecular-level interactions rather than continuum approximation systems. These simulations seemed more aligned with the projects offered in chemical engineering departments.

A few months and numerous graduate school applications later, I began working with Prof. Sapna Sarupria on a project involving molecular simulations of seawater desalination membranes. My current work involves simulating ion transport within sub-nanometer membrane pores, aiming to enhance our understanding of the salt rejection mechanism in water filters.

While I'm still exploring the advances in molecular simulations and facing challenges in making impactful contributions, I'm inclined to remain in this field. I've also expanded my expertise to scientific software development, which has significantly aided in systematically exploring my research questions. I'm enthusiastic about tackling challenging problems at the convergence of material science, biophysics, and machine learning. Unless, of course, I find myself writing another blog post about a shift to a different field!
