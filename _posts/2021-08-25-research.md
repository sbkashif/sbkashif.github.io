My PhD project involves using molecular simulations to study ion transport in membranes. Most likely, my future work profile would be centered around molecular simulations. Therefore, in this blog post today, I would share my thoughts on how I ended up chosing this field of work -- a gentle mix of decisions driven by both naviety and genuine interest in the topic.

From what I recall, it was a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) workshop that I attended during my sophomore year that stoked my interest in computational work. Other than the wonderful insights that CFD simulation offered in a simple flow in a pipe system, there was another sight that were to remain forever itched in my memory (ED), or till date for the least. There was a fellow student guiding one of the faculty members on creating the geometries in Ansys Design Modeler (DM). That faculy member was our instructor of a very rigrous course -- Engineering Drawing (ED). We used to spend nights to come up with okayish techincal drawings which would fetch average grades. The Ansys DM was offering a way to create drawing that had very little to do with the skillful hands of that instructor or any other student who was good with ED. I saw this software as a leveler. Later I would learn that AutoCAD and not Ansys DM is the suitable software, and more importantly, that the concepts learned in ED course were in no way obsolete. However, I was convinced that computational tools are indepsnsible in any field and building a career around those would be both exciting and rewarding.

In the coming years, I would gain exposure on various computaional tools, from writing a C code on Newton-Raphson techniue as part of a course to doing a project using the Image Processing Tool of MATLAB. Eventually, I managed to find an MS position which involved a CFD-based project on modeling the flow of ammonia in a microchannel. While doing this project, I were to discover that CFD is not the best tool to study these kind problems as there would be limited insights into the reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen and just modeling the fluid dynamics will not suffice. More so, fluid was not my primary interest anymore. I had picked some keywords like monte carlo simulations while reading the literature and I thought those techiques would be better suited for someone with chemical engineering background. Yes, I would later find out that this was a naive thinking too.

A few months and numerous grad school applications later, I began my work with Prof. Sapna Sarupria on a project involving molecular simulation of seawater desalination membranes. The project where I would be working with a molecular scale resolution instead of continuum approximation. Although, a thorough modeling of reactions would involve using quantum simulations but molecular simulations are best suited for the problem I am studying for my PhD dissertaion. More importantly, a deep dive in the literature coupled with the excellent training on simulations and coding that I have received in the Sarupria group has cemented my interest in this technique.

In the future, I am excited to gain newer insights into various phenomenon in the field of material scicence and/or biomolecular engineering while actively developing related software tools. Unless I find myself writing another blog explaining my switch to another field :)
