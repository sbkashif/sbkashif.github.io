In this blog post today, I am going to recollect on why and how I ended up choosing to work in the field of computational molecular sciences -- a mix of decisions that were sometimes driven by naviety and something with careful consideration. 

From what I recall, it was a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) workshop that I attended during my sophomore year that stoked my interest in computational work. Alongside being impressed with the profound insights that CFD simulations offered in a simple flow in a pipe system, there was another sight which is fresh in my memory to date. I saw a fellow student helping a faculty member in creating the geometries on Ansys Design Modeler (DM). That faculy member was our instructor of a very rigrous course -- Engineering Drawing (ED). We used to spend nights to come up with okayish techincal drawings which would fetch us average grades. The Ansys DM software appeared a leveler where the skillfull hands of that instructor had little impact on the neatness of drawings. Later, of course, I would come to know that engineering drawings are better done on specialized software like AutoCAD, and more importantly, that the skills learned from the ED course were in no way obselete. What I was still convinded about was that the computational tools are indepsnsible in any field, and building a career around those would be both exciting and rewarding.

For the remainder of my undergred program, I would study the computational courses with a greater zeal. I startede to enjoy writing codes and did my undergrad project using the Image Processing Tool of MATLAB. Eventually, I joined a masters program where I would do a  CFD-based project on modeling the N2/H2 flow in a microchannel for potential application in ammonia synthesis. While doing this project, I realized that CFD anlaysis will not suffice in driving the project to the desired outcome, and it would need a kinetic and thermodynamic study. More so, fluid dynamics was not my primary interest anymore. I was more interested in molecular-level interactions, than studying the systems under continuum approximation. My naive self also thought that the molecular interactions would be all that is needed in knowing whatever we need to know about a given system. 

A few months and numerous grad school applications later, I began my work with Prof. Sapna Sarupria on a project involving molecular simulations of seawater desalination membranes. I am working on simulating the ion path inside the membrane pores in sub-nm domain, a study that that is aimed to get a better understanding of salt rejection mechanism in water filters. While the simulations at this scale will help finding the answer to my current research question, ultimately it would be a multi-scale model that would be needed to answer all what we need to know to design better water filers. 

My interest in molecular simulations is still intact,and I have also extended my domain to scientific software development. In future, I am excited to study challenging problems in the field of material science and/or biophysics. Unless I find myself writing another blog post explaining my switch to yet another field :)
