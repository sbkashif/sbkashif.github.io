In today's blog post, I will reflect on my journey as a practitioner of computational modeling and simulations. My career path has been influenced by a combination of impulses coming from fascination with innovative technologies, and deliberate pursuits that were informed by thorough research and relevant experiences.

I remember attending a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) workshop during my sophomore year, which ignited my interest in computer simulations. The profound insights I gained from CFD simulations, particularly from a tutorial on a simple flow in a pipe system, were impressive and far exceeded what I had learned about the same system in a transport course just a couple of days earlier. A vivid memory that remains with me is witnessing a fellow student assisting a faculty member in using Ansys Design Modeler (DM). This faculty member, who also taught our rigorous Engineering Drawing (ED) course, presented a stark contrast in this new setting. We often spent a huge amount of time preparing okayish technical drawings which would fetch average grades. The Ansys DM software seemed to be a leveler of sorts, in terms of the impact of skillful hands on the neatness of drawings. Of course, later I would learn more specialized engineering drawing tools and, more importantly, understand that the learning outcomes from that ED course were far from obsolete. Nonetheless, this experience cemented my belief in the indispensable nature of computational tools across various fields, promising an exciting and rewarding career (well, the latter aspect is still a far-fetched goal).

For the rest of my undergraduate program, I pursued computational courses with increased enthusiasm. I enjoyed coding assignments, and also chose to work on MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox for my undergraduate project. This led me to a master's program, where I embarked on a CFD-based project focusing on fluid flow modeling in microchannels. Delving into literature and receiving feedback during biannual project reviews, I realized that CFD analysis alone wouldn't suffice to answer the questions I was after. Those questions required kinetic and thermodynamic modeling alongside fluid dynamics for experimental validation. With limited time in my master's program, I couldn't explore the chemistry aspects further. However, I became fascinated with studying molecular-level interactions which seemed more aligned with the projects offered in chemical engineering departments.

A few months and numerous graduate school applications later, I began working with Prof. Sapna Sarupria on a project involving molecular simulations of seawater desalination membranes. My current work involves simulating fouling mechanisms in polyamide membranes, a widely used commerical membrane material for water filters. An improved understanding of fouling mechanisms would eventually help developing filters with a longer lifespan. In another project, I am studying ion transport within sub-nanometer membrane pores of polyamide, aiming to enhance our understanding of ion selectivity.

While I'm still exploring the advances in molecular simulations and facing challenges in making impactful contributions, I'm inclined to remain in this field. I've also expanded my expertise to scientific software development, which has significantly aided in systematically exploring my research questions. I'm enthusiastic about tackling challenging problems at the convergence of material science, biophysics, and machine learning. Unless, of course, I find myself writing another blog post about a shift to a different field!
