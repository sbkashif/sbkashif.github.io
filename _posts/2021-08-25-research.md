I work in the field of computational molecular sciences. In this blog post today, I will share how I ended up choosing this field of work -- my recollection of decisions which were sometimes naive,and most other times thoughtful.

From what I recall, it was a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) workshop that I attended during my sophomore year that stoked my interest in computational work. Alongside being impressed with the profound insights that CFD simulations offered in a simple flow in a pipe system, there was another sight which I keep remembering to date. I saw a fellow student helping a faculty member in creating the geometries on Ansys Design Modeler (DM). That faculy member was our instructor of a very rigrous course -- Engineering Drawing (ED). We used to spend nights to come up with okayish techincal drawings which would fetch us average grades. The Ansys DM software appeared a leveler where the skillfull hands of that instructor had little withe neatness of drawings. Later, of course, I would come to know that engineering drawing is done on specialized software like AutoCAD, and more importantly, that the skills learned from the ED course were in no way obselete. But I was convinced that the computational tools are indepsnsible in any field, and building a career around those would be both exciting and rewarding.

For the remainder of my undergred program, I would study the computational courses with a great zeal, be it writing C codes for a numerical method or doing a complete project using the Image Processing Tool of MATLAB. Eventually, I joined a masters program where I would do a  CFD-based project on modeling the flow of ammonia in a microchannel. While doing this project, I realized that CFD is not the best tool to study these kind of problems as there would be limited insights into the reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen and just modeling the fluid dynamics will not suffice. More so, fluid dynamics was not my primary interest anymore. I was more interested in molecular-level interactions, than studying the systems under continuum approximation. My naive self also thought that the molecular interactions would be all that is needed in knowing whatever we need to know about a given system. 

A few months and numerous grad school applications later, I began my work with Prof. Sapna Sarupria on a project involving molecular simulations of seawater desalination membranes. I am working on simulating the ion path inside the membrane pores in sub-nm domain, a study that that is aimed to get a better understanding of salt rejection mechanism in water filters. While the simulations at this scale will help finding the answer to my currenr research question, ultimately it would be a multi-scale model that would be needed to answer all what we need to know to design better water filers. 

While working on my current problem statement, I have cemented my interest around molecular simulations, extending to machine learning and scientific software development. In future, I am excited to study challenging problems in the field of material science and/or biophysics. Unless I find myself writing another blog post explaining my switch to yet another field :)
