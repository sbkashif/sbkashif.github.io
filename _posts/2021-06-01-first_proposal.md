title: My first (formal) research proposal writing experience

I aspire to build a career in academia, and would be spending a major chunk of  my time in the future in writing (hopefully funded!) research proposals. My very first proposal writing experience will, hence, hold a special place in my memory. I would definitely look back at this experience with a smile. 

If my previous cues weren't enough, let me explicitly state that my very first proposal (well, second too!) was not recommended for funding. In fact, the reviews weren't encouraging either. However, there was still a tremendous amount of learning that came with it which I am sharing in this blog post.

My very first learning had nothing to do with the content of the proposal. It is regarding planning the propsoal. I did not start writing it well ahead of time and, hence, missed out on getting the comprehensive feedback on it.

[To be completed]
