title: My first research proposal writing experience

I aspire to work in an R&D setting. In the roles relating to the R&D, as I am told, a good chunk of time goes in writing (funded) research proposals. My very first proposal submission is, therefore, special for me and I would definitely look back at this experience with a smile. 

I applied for the software fellowship offered by [The Molecular Sciences Software Institute](https://molssi.org/fellowship/), which invited two-page proposals on designing software for challenging computational chemistry problems. My proposal was not recommended for funding. The reviews that I got weren't very encouraging either. However, as with any other experience, there was a lot of learning.

My very first learning had less to do with the content of the proposal, but rather with the importance of proper planning. I did not start writing it well ahead of time and, hence, missed out on getting a comprehensive feedback. A proposal is hardly polished with only a few iterations of reviews and corrections. One should have their first draft ready a couple of months in advance to get feedback from people with different level of exposure to the given topic, with your research advisor being one of them.

Secondly, as I deduced from the reviews, a successful proposal is not just about the content or importance of the research question that is proposed. The reviewers refer to various aspects of the candidate's profile, with the outcome of previous projects being most important (including the time taken for completion). They need some form of an assurace that the candidate will deliver on what they are promising. In this instance, my GitHub profile went for the scrutiny. My repos were far from the basic best practices guidelines, and two reviewers clearly pointed that out. In many fellowship applications, publication record is very important in getting a favorable decision, and this was probably another vertical where I would have lost points.

Thirdly, it is important to propose a workable timeline on top of a brilliant idea. My reviewers weren't convinced that what I was proposing may be completed in the timeline of the fellowship.

Lastly, I would note some positive outcomes from this experience. Some reviewers did comment that my proposal was "well-written" and it was a useful problem to study. I thoroughly enjoyed this experience. I was pleasently surprised with the amount of literature I can read, and the newer ideas I can come up with. 

I look forward to my first successful propsoal where I can refer to this post :)
