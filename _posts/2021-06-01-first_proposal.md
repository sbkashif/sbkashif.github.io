title: My first (formal) research proposal writing experience

I aspire to work in an R&D setting. In the roles relating to the R&D, a major chunk of time in such jobs goes in writing (funded) research proposals. My very first proposal submission will, hence, is special for me and I would definitely look back at this experience with a smile. 

If the cue I provided in the last sentence wasn't enough, let me state that my first proposal was not recommended for funding. The reviews that I got weren't encouraging either. However, as with almost every other experience, there was a lot of learning that came with it. I applied for the software fellowship offered by The Molecular Sciences Software Institute.

My very first learning had less to do with the content of the proposal, but rather with the importance of proper planning. I did not start writing it well ahead of time and, hence, missed out on getting a comprehensive feedback. A proposal is hardly polished with only a few iterations of reviews and corrections. One should have their first draft ready well in advance to get feedback from people with different level of exposure with the given topic, with your research advisor being one of them.

Secondly, I realized that a perfect content in the proposal isn't enough to secure the funding. The reviewers have to be convinced that the money spent would result in useful knowledge creation. They refer to various aspects of the candidate's profile, with the outcome of previous projects being most important. They need some form of an assurace that the candidate will deliver on what they are promising. In this instance, my GitHub profile went for the scutiny. My repos were far from the basic best practices guidelines, and two reviewers clearly pointed that out. From what I have been told, in many funding applications, publication record is very important in getting a favorable decision.

Thirdly, it is important to propose a workable timeline on top of a brilliant idea. My reviewers weren't convinced that what I was proposing may be completed in the timeline of the fellowship.

Lastly, it's not that everything was bad with my proposal. Some reviewers did comment that my proposal was "well-written" and it was a useful problem to study. I thoroughly enjoyed this experience. I was pleasently surprised with the amount of literature I can read, and the newer ideas I can come up with. 

I look forward to my first successful propsoal where I can refer to this post.
