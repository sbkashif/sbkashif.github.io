title: My first (formal) research proposal writing experience

I aspire to build a career in academia. I would, therefore, be spending a major chunk of  my time in the future in writing (hopefully funded!) research proposals. My very first proposal submission will, hence, hold a special place in my memory. I would definitely look back at this experience with a smile. 

If my previous cues weren't enough, I have to explicitly state my very first proposal (well, second too!) was not recommended for funding. There you go! The reviews weren't encouraging either. However, as with almost every other experience, there was a lot of learning that came with it. The proposal was submitted for MolSSI Software Fellowship.

My very first learning had nothing to do with the content of the proposal. It is regarding planning the propsoal. I did not start writing it well ahead of time and, hence, missed out on getting the comprehensive feedback on it.

Secondly, I realized that a perfect content in the proposal isn't enough to secure the funding. The reviewers have to be convinced that the money spent would result in useful knowledge creation. They refer to various aspects of candidates profile so as to ensure that the candidate will deliver what they are promising. In my case, the profile that went for scrutiny was that of GitHub. My repos were far from the basic best practices guidelinesi, and two reviewers clearly pointed that out. In case of regular NSF funding, the candiadate's publication record is evaluated.

Third, it is important to propose a workable timeline in addition to a brilliant idea. My reviewers weren't convinced that what I was proposing may be completed in the timeline of fellowship.

Lastly, it's not that everything was bad with my proposal. A lot of reviewers did comment that my proposal was "well-written" and it was a useful problem to study.

This proposal writing experience has strongly influenced my descision to put a sincere attempt in getting a faculty position in a research university. I look forward to my first successful propsoal where I can actually refer to this post. My final submission is that the decision not going my way in my first two proposal had more to do with my profile and not much with the content of the proposal.
