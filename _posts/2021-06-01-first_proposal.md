title: My first (formal) research proposal writing experience

I aspire to build a career in academia, and would be spending a major chunk of  my time in the furture in writing (hopefully funded!) research proposals. My first first proposal writing experience will, hence, always be special. I would want to look back at this experience with a smile, and I am recoding it here assuming that a few other academics will relate to it.

If you already couln't catch the clues by now, I would state that my very first proposal (well, second too!) was not recommended for funding. In fact, the reviews weren't encouraging either.
