My background is in chemical engineering, with a strong inclination towards computer simulations. The particular thing that fascinates me about computer simulations is the extent of control in studying the role of different parameters in a system  â€“ independently, combined, and everything in between.

My ideal work profile would be at the intersection of molecular simulations, machine learning, and software development, focusing on challenging polymer science and/or biophysics problems.

For my Ph.D. dissertation, I am studying the solute rejection mechanism in polyamide membranes using molecular simulations coupled with advanced sampling. My work will eventually help in designing membranes with better water-ion selectivity. I am also planning to expand on studying ion-ion selectivity in the future. In another project, I am developing an open-source Python package for generating the starting structure of amorphous polymers to do molecular simulations.

I like listening to music, reading, and taking long walks in the neighborhood.
