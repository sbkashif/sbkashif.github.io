While pursuing my degrees in chemical engineering, right from bachelor's to doctorate, my inclination has always been towards computer simulations. I am particularly fascinated with the extent of control that simulations provide in evaluating the role of various parameters for a given system â€“ independently, combined, and everything in between.

In the future, I aspire to work at the intersection of molecular simulations, machine learning, and software development, focusing on challenging polymer science and/or biophysics problems.

For my Ph.D. dissertation, I am studying the solute rejection mechanism in polyamide membranes using molecular simulations coupled with advanced sampling. My work will eventually help in designing membranes with better water-ion selectivity. I am also planning to expand on studying ion-ion selectivity in the future. In another project, I am developing an open-source Python package for generating the starting structure of amorphous polymers to do molecular simulations.

I like listening to music, reading, and taking long walks in the neighborhood.
