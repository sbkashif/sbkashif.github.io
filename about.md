I have a chemical engineering background with primary interest in modelling and simulation. For my PhD dissertaion, I am studying desalination membranes using molecular simulations. I use molecular simulations coupled with advanced sampling techniqes to investigate the salt reaction mechanisms in polyamide membranes. My work will eventually help in designing membranes with better selectivity. I am also working on developing an open-source Python package for generating the atomistic structure of amorphous polymers to do molecular simulations.
