 My background is in Chemical Engineering, with a strong inclination for computer simulations. I am greatly fascinated with the vast possibilites that engineers can explore from a simulation software. I love the level of control that computer simulations provide for exploring the paramater space, unless one is dealing with the amorphous polymers :p

My interest in computer simulations was stoked from a computational fluid dynamics workshop during my junior year. Eventually, I shifted to molecular simulations at the start of my PhD for their relevance to the systems I was interested in studying. I aspire to work at the intersection of molecular modeling, machine learning and material science in thecoming years. 

For my PhD dissertation, I am using molecular dynamics simulations coupled with advanced sampling techniques to understand the solute rejection mechanism in polyamide membranes. My work is aimed towards helping with designing membranes with better water-ion selectivity in the future. In another project, I am working on developing an open-source Python package for generating the starting structure of amorphous polymers to do molecular simulations. 

Outside work, I like listening to music, reading, and taking long walks in the neighbourhood.
