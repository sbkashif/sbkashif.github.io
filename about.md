My background is in chemical engineering, with primary interest in modeling and simulation. I am greatly fascinated with the insights computational techniques provide in understanding a given phenomenon. 

For my PhD dissertation, I am using molecular dynamics simulations coupled with advanced sampling techniques to understand the solute rejection mechanism in polyamide membrane. My work will eventually help in designing membranes with better solute-solute selectivity. In another project, I am working on developing an open-source Python package for generating the starting structure of amorphous polymers to do molecular simulations. 

Outside work, I like listening to music, reading, and taking long walks in the neighbourhood.
