My background is in chemical engineering. My primary interest lies in exploring the potential of computational techniques in desinging new materials. I am greatly fascinated by the extent of understanding the computational techniques provide in a given field, particularly in providing the precise control of the influencing parameters.  

For my PhD dissertation, I am using molecular dynamics simulations coupled with advanced sampling techniques to understand the solute rejection mechanism in polyamide membrane. My work will eventually help in designing membranes with better solute-solute selectivity. In another project, I am working on developing an open-source Python package for generating the starting structure of amorphous polymers to do molecular simulations. 

Outside work, I like listening to music, taking long walks in the neighbourhood and reading.
