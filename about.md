My educational background is in chemical engineering, with specialized expertise at the intersection of molecular simulations, software development and machine learning.

For my Ph.D. dissertation, I studied fouling mechanism and selectivity of polyamide membranes using molecular simulations coupled with advanced sampling. Prior to molecular simulation studies, I developed a generalized python tool to generate initial configurations for molecular simulations of polymer systems. Later, I utilized machine learning models for rapid exploration of design spacce in developing fouling-resistant membranes.

I am currently looking for opportunities requiring expertise in studying polymeric and biomolecular systems using computational tools. I am also interested in developing software tools for scientific research.

Outside work, I like listening to music, watching soccer and cricket, reading, and taking long walks in the neighborhood.
