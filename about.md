As a work profile, I am greatly fascinated with the potential of computer simulations in solving the engineering problems. In particular, with the extent of control in setting up the systems for evalutaing the role of various parameters.

My experience with the simulations has mostly been with performing molecular dynamics simulations using the open source software. I have some experience with developing the open source software packages as well. I aspire to work at the intersection of molecular modeling, machine learning and software development in the future, focusing on challenging polymer science and/or biophysics problems.   

For my PhD dissertation, I am studying the solute rejection mechanism in polyamide membrane using molecular simulations coupled with the advanced sampling. My work will eventually help in designing membranes with better water-ion selectivity. I am also plan to expand on studying the ion-ion selectivity in the future. In another project, I am working on developing an open-source Python package for generating the starting structure of amorphous polymers to do molecular simulations. 

Outside work, I like listening to music, reading, and taking long walks in the neighbourhood.
