I have a chemical engineering background with primary interest in modelling and simulation. For my PhD dissertaion, the system of study is desalination membranes. I use molecular simulations to understand the fouling as well as salt reaction mechanisms in polyamide membranes. I am also working on developing an open-source Python package for generating the starting structures of amorphous polymers for molcular simulations.
