This page is dedicated to sharing my journey in learning fundamental concepts in molecular simulations and machine learning. The objective is to understand the underlying principles and algorithms behind widely used software packages and libraries by coding key building blocks from scratch.

In areas where I’m still building foundational knowledge (no pun intended!) — such as quantum chemistry, machine learning interatomic potentials, and large language models (LLMs) — the content will mainly consist of structured notes and accompanying code snippets from tutorials and courses I follow.
