This page documents my journey through essentials of molecular simulations, machine learning, and scientific computing. My objective is to understand the underlying algorithms by coding their core building blocks from scratch. As it scales, this resource evolves into a turnkey onboarding document for my future trainees

In areas where I’m still building foundational knowledge — such as quantum chemistry, machine learning interatomic potentials, parallel programming, and large language models (LLMs) — the content will mainly consist of structured notes and accompanying code snippets borrowed from online courses and tutorials.
